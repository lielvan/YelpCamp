# YelpCamp

A camping site review application that allows users to sign up and upload a campsite name/description/picture/location/etc.
If a user wishes to edit a campsite that they added, they must first sign in, and only then will the middleware allow them to make the necessary changes.
Users are also allowed to submit/edit comments on any campsite on the site!

Technologies and tools used:

* NodeJS
* ExpressJS
* Bootstrap 4
* MongoDB Atlas
* Authentication (PassportJS)
* Git
* Heroku

The app is currently deployed on Heroku servers - [YELPCAMP LINK](http://lvdh-yelp-camp.herokuapp.com)

P.S. It's deployed using Heroku's free servers so it might take a few seconds to load :)
